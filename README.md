# Rap Yap
Rap Yap is a series of online games developed to help hone public speaking skills through practicing freestyle rap.  You can visit the [live page now](https://lichard49.github.io/rap-yap).

These games were submitted as a final design project for CS 6460 at Georgia Tech by team Learners of the North.

Rap Yap was built using the [Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com/), a CSS framework based on the Material Design guidelines set by Google, and the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/), for generating random words and verifying rhymes using syllables.  HTML5's webkitSpeechRecognition was also used, so the webapp will only work in Chrome for now.
